                    <p>Ten of the lessons in <em>High School Economics</em> include web-based <a href="http://interactives.councilforeconed.org/">interactive supplements</a>. These supplements range from simple online worksheets designed to help teachers make the best possible use of instructional time to rich, collaborative activities that have students working together and interacting with each other. The collaborative activities are designed to be easy to use and are built around CEE’s commitment to active learning. They don’t require managing multiple sets of student usernames and passwords. Teachers are able to create a special web address for each group that they can distribute to their students. At the end of the activity, teachers can download all of the data generated by their students and use those data to illustrate the concepts covered in the lesson.</p>

                    <p>In this lesson, students play the role of either buyers or sellers of labor to examine the interconnectedness of individuals and companies in labor markets. Students learn that the demand and supply for labor determine market wage rates and that wages depend, in part, on individual productivity.</p>
